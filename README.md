**Hello, welcome to simple node video server project by Philipp Dubrivny :)**

In order to launch this project please install dependencies by running `npm install`
in your terminal and execute `npm start` command to start the server. Then open your preferred browser
and open `localhost:8080`. You'll see a simple HTML page where you can place a link to video file and 
after a few seconds (depends on video file size) it'll start playing. The server downloads a video into public directory 
and starts playback.
